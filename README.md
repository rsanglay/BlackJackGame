# BlackJackGame

Here's a brief overview of the different parts of the program:

Classes:
We'll define two classes, one for the deck of cards and one for the player's hand. The deck of cards will contain 52 cards, and the player's hand will be initialized as an empty list.
Functions:
We'll define several functions to handle different parts of the game, such as dealing cards, calculating hand values, checking for busts, and checking for blackjack.
Loops:
We'll use a while loop to keep the game running until the player chooses to quit or runs out of chips. Within the loop, we'll use another loop to allow the player to keep hitting until they decide to stand.
User Inputs:
The player will be prompted to make different choices throughout the game, such as hitting or standing. We'll use the input function to get their responses and update the game accordingly.
Here's a more detailed breakdown of how the game will work:

Define the deck class:
This class will initialize the deck of cards and shuffle it at the beginning of the game.
Define the hand class:
This class will initialize the player's hand as an empty list and provide methods to add cards to the hand and calculate the hand value.
Define the deal function:
This function will deal two cards to the player and two cards to the dealer, with one of the dealer's cards face down.
Define the hit function:
This function will deal one card to the player and update their hand value.
Define the stand function:
This function will end the player's turn and start the dealer's turn.
Define the dealer_turn function:
This function will play the dealer's turn, hitting until their hand value is at least 17 or they bust.
Define the calculate_score function:
This function will calculate the player's score and return it as a string.
Define the check_bust function:
This function will check if the player has busted (their hand value is over 21) and end the game if they have.
Define the check_blackjack function:
This function will check if the player has blackjack (an Ace and a card with a value of 10) and end the game if they do.
Define the play_game function:
This function will handle the main game loop, prompting the player to hit or stand and updating the game accordingly until the game ends.
